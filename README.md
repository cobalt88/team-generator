 ## Contribution Guidelines
 - - -
 If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to do so. Some things to keep in mind:

 1. Please use structured/formatted commit messages that adhere to the following guideline: git commit -m "{the date of the commit}" -m "{detailed description of the changes}" -m "{who is making the commit}"
 for now this is just a personal preference to keep the repository nice and tidy, eventually these guidelines will be updated to reflect whatever version nomenclature i decide to use. 

 2. Do Not open a pull request on the main branch, it will be denied. period. Start a new feature branch or open a pull request to develop so your contributions can be reviewed first. 

 3. Comment your code, since I didn't write your code i might not know right away what it does. Please keep your code clean, tidy, and well commented to make integration of features more seamless. 

 4. if you'd like to be a regular contributor reach out and ask to be a collaborator,
